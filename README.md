- **Frontend**: Planned: .NET MAUI for cross-platform mobile and desktop applications, XAML for UI design
- **API Documentation**: Swagger for API testing and documentation
- **Logging**: Serilog for structured logging
- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for source code management
- **Other Tools**: Docker (for future containerization support), NUnit and xUnit for unit testing

      dotnet ef database update
      ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    - Backend dependencies:
      ```bash
      dotnet restore
      ```
